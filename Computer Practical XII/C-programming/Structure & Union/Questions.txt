Lab works-2(struct and unions)
1. WAP to input id, name and grade for 10 students.Then print them. Use array of structure concept.
2. WAP to input 20 employees name, position andsalary. Then search a record of an employee and its position on the basis ofname.
3. We have two structures as given below.struct employee{    charename[100];    chareaddress[100];};struct salarydetails{char pos[100];float salary;struct employee detail;}payinfo; WAP to input employees’ details with salarythen print them. Use nested struct concept.
4. WAP to input id, name and address of 20 studentsusing struct. Then print them in sorted format on the basis of name.
5. WAP to input any 10 teacher’s id, name andsubject using ‘typedef’ and structure. Then print them on screen.
6. WAP using function and structure to calculatesum of two distances measured in terms of kilometers and meters.
For example,If we input following data
Kilometer                        meter
23                                445
45                                756
69                                201
The output would be 69 km and 201 meters.
7.WAP to input student id, name and grade andprint them. Use union concept.
